      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-2">To schedule an update, simply click on the start date on the calendar and
        select the months to update on, as well as the time and start date if you wish to specify this, and the days on
        which to update. For example, if you select &ldquo;Jan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mar&rdquo; as the months, and
        &ldquo;5&rdquo; and &ldquo;21&rdquo; as the days, the
        scraper will run on January 5<sup>th</sup>, January 21<sup>st</sup>, March 5<sup>th</sup>, and March
        21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-2">The time is the time when the scraper will run on the selected dates, it
        can be left blank to start near midnight. If the time is left blank, the scheduler will intentionally wait a
        random amount of time (less than one minute) before scraping, in order to prevent the server from being
        overloaded. If the time is defined, the scraper will start at exactly that time.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-2">The scraper will start on or
        after the specified start date if it is specified. The start date can be left blank if you want the scraper to
        start on the next selected day.</p>
